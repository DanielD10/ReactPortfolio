            Currently pursuing a Full Stack Development certificate, as i
          continue to navigate my way into CyberLaw. Skills in HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, Mongodb, Express, React, and Node.js. Strengths in
          balancing design and functionality, as well as collaboration. During my time in
          the coding bootcamp, my collaboration skills have grew tremendously as
          we completed projects, such as a Full Stack app that allows aspiring
          individuals, hoping to get into certain fields, find resources to help
          them get started. Prarticularlly during this project I saw my UI/UX
          skills greatly improve. Enrolling in the bootcamp made me realize that
          I enjoy problem solving and through coding I would like to resolve
          real world problems. I look forward to utilizing the skills Iâ€™ve
          learned to provide the best solutions.
